#### 🌟 Projects
- **[Web_Crawler](https://github.com/YCNeo/Web_Crawler)**: This repo is a **TypeScript collection of web crawlers** built for different purposes. It organizes crawler outputs into datasets (e.g., a house-price dataset) and serves as a reusable toolkit for scraping structured data.

- **[1132_Data_Science_Final](https://github.com/YCNeo/1132_Data_Science_Final)**: This project analyzes **Taipei housing prices and rents** and builds prediction models using geocoding plus **MRT-based features** (e.g., distance to the nearest station and line info). It shows MRT distance is a significant factor and provides an end-to-end pipeline from data processing to regression modeling.

- **[Latexfer](https://github.com/YCNeo/Latexfer)**: Latexfer is a small toolkit/workspace for writing and compiling **LaTeX with LuaLaTeX**, including practical notes for **English/Chinese font setup** and Word editing workflow. It also documents reusable **ChatGPT prompts** for generating elementary-school math handouts in LaTeX.

- **[ESG](https://github.com/YCNeo/ESG)**: This project builds an easy-to-use digital record and dashboard platform for farmers, turning daily transaction/performance logs into a simple electronic workflow. Using a blockchain-backed backend plus a modern web frontend, it helps farmers record data quickly and generate government-required reports with minimal effort.
  
- **[Amisfer](https://github.com/YCNeo/Amisfer)**: This project is an **interactive AI learning platform for the Siouguluan Amis language**,  focusing on translating Amis and Chinese/English. Using machine learning, it aims to reduce the amount of required bilingual vocabulary alignment and lower the baseline expertise needed for translators.
